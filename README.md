Data visualization using shiny r, shiny python, and python flask

## Shiny R

Currently having difficulties with some of my data not showing up, as it seems like R is auto-removing some of the rows with empty values despite no empty values being present. Wokring on fixing this

## Shiny Python

Had initial issues with the requirements.txt file, as shiny was pip-freezing the Google shell environment, and the 200+ packages shell has installed were causing a number of issues due to version numbers. I wrote my own requirements.txt but it didn't read it so I just switched to VSCode to work locally and had no issues

## Python Flask

No issues here really, deployed smoothly.
